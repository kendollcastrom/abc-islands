            <p>How does your shuffling work? How do I know it's fair?<br />We treat letters fairly and honestly. Once the deck is mixed, it is set and you cannot change the order in which the cards are dealt. The software that shuffles and deals the cards cannot control who wins or loses; It only deals the cards and the rest depends on the players in the game. Our software produces a completely random combination, which does not favor any player over any other. The methods we use ensure complete randomization of the cards which makes it unpredictable to determine the cards to come.</p>
            <p>We arranged for the largest software security and quality consulting firm iTech Labs Australia to review our deck. Their research found that the deck was fair and random.</p>
            <p>If you have further questions regarding our deck or security of our software, feel free to ask our Support service any questions you may like. The integrity of our games is paramount to our success and we are happy to address any concerns you may have.</p>
            <p>How can they ensure the integrity of your games?<br />We make the security of our games a priority and use state-of-the-art technology to protect the integrity of our games.<br /><br />Collusion or chip transfer is strictly prohibited and any player who is involved in any kind of fund exchange agreement cannot play at the same cash game table or in the same Sit &amp; Go tournament. Unfair gambling, such as collusion, abuse of multiple accounts, and use of prohibited programs may result in penalties at our discretion. These penalties may include warnings, restrictions on playing with certain players, seizure of funds, and closure of your account.<br />We maintain a list of prohibited software programs and services on our FAQ page about third-party tools and services. You cannot use any of the programs or services on the "forbidden" list while the software is running. The list is not exhaustive and we reserve the right to add or modify the list at any time. We will take steps to detect and prevent all forms of deception, which may include examining your account, hand history, and programs running concurrently with our software.<br />We do not use any house players or robots. We do not hire any individuals to play on our site.</p>
            <p>Can your employees play on your site?<br />No. Any employee or contractor who has access to privileged information (player records, hidden card hand history, etc.) will not be able to play on our site. This is to prevent any possible abuse of that privileged information. In fact, the immediate relatives of those people are also not allowed to play on our site.</p>

            <p>What are your terms of service?<br />Please read our Online Poker Site Terms of Service&nbsp;<a href="https://media.betimages.com/media/rules/Terms&amp;ConditionsPokerWebsite.docx">here.</a></p>
            <p>I would like to play under different names. Can I have more than one account?<br />Each player is only allowed one account. It is not allowed to close your account and open another one. Once you create an account, your uasuario or nickname cannot be changed, so choose carefully.</p>
            <p>How can I help keep my account secure?<br />Protecting your password is your responsibility. Never reveal your account information to anyone. We will never ask you to send us your password and the only place you should use it is when you log in to the software. We recommend that you change your password regularly</p>
            <p>I don't receive emails sent to my inbox.<br />This may be the result of your email provider mislabeling our emails as spam. If so, the problem is easily corrected by adding us to the safe senders list in your email software or marking an email from us as "not spam."</p>
            <p>Can I change the language in which the software appears?<br />Yes, you can. We offer 6 software language preferences.</p>
            <p>Change language You can choose another language using the desktop client, through the menu select "Settings" on the right side of the main lobby and choose the language<br />from the drop-down menu.</p>

						<p>What happens if I disconnect in the middle of one hand?<br />Occasionally it happens that due to reasons that are beyond the control of our players, they cannot act in time on their poker hand. A player in a cash game (non-tournament) typically has 25 seconds to act with his hand if it is a fixed limit poker game and 35 seconds in a pot-limit or no limit poker game. A warning message is displayed in the chat box with 15 seconds left to act. If there was a disconnection and a player returned before timeout, he or she is given at least 10 seconds to act. Less time is allocated to perform at designated "fast" tables.<br />If a player is unable to perform within the allotted time while connected, the system bends the hand.<br />Additional time may be allocated to perform in some games, depending on the situation. The amount of extra time may vary depending on the game, but the concept is the same at all times: when faced with a decision on a larger pot, more time is given to return due to a disconnection.</p>
            <p>Please note that tournaments do not allocate additional time due to disconnections, in most situations.</p>
            <p>What happens if the system crashes in the middle of a game?<br />All transactions, including jackpots won and lost, are recorded in your account at the end of each hand. In the unlikely event of a server crash preventing the completion of a hand, the hands in progress at each table (tournaments and cash games) will be restored by pushing back these hands as if they had not happened. Each player's chip count will be reset to the amount at the beginning of the hand.</p>
            <p>The poker game I wish to join is full. What should I do?<br />If a poker game is full, you can put your name on the waiting list for that game. When an in-game seat becomes available, the first person on the waiting list will have the first right of rejection for that seat.</p>
            <p>The other option you have is to sit at a table empty of that limit and game. Often, empty tables fill up quickly once a player takes a seat.</p>
            <p>What is a "rake"? How much does rake cost in poker games?<br />In our poker games, you never play against the house, only against other players. We receive compensation by taking a rake, a small amount from each cash pot. This jackpot rake never exceeds $5. At the lower limits, we take a smaller rake.</p>
            <p>There is no rake "by hand" in tournaments; There is only an initial fee to enter.</p>
            <p>How do I know how much money is in the pot?<br />At any of our tables, the total jackpot amount, including all current bets, are always displayed numerically on the table. Also, at the end of each betting round, all bets are collected in the center of the table and converted into higher denomination chips so you can easily see the total jackpot value.</p>
            <p>What is the difference between No Limit, Pot Limit and Fixed Limit poker?<br />The betting structure for a particular game sets the limits of how much you can bet each time you have to act and in the case of CAP games, how much you can bet in total on each hand.<br />In poker games with an unlimited betting structure, each player can bet or increase by any amount up to and including their full stack (the total number of chips they possess at any given time) in any betting round, provided it is their turn to Act. In poker games with a jackpot limit betting structure, each player can bet or increase by any amount up to the size of the total jackpot at that time. In poker games with a fixed limit betting structure, each player can choose to match, bet or increase, but only for a fixed amount.</p>
