Players may not earn more than $5000 per day or $ 10,000 per week per provider, once this happens the provider will be suspended for the rest of the week. In case of having the provider suspended for this period, players will be able to access our other casino provider options.

Weekly calculations are held from Monday (00:00 AM to Sunday (11:59 PM).</li>
              <li>The limits are put into action the moment the casino bet exceeds the established parameter. This means that the result of the last bet will be taken into account for the final balance and activation of the provider limit.</li>
