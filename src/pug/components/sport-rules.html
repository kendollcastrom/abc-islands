						<h3>Baseball lines</h3>
						<p>
							Baseball games can be wagered three different ways:
							Money Line, Run Line and Totals. For the Totals and
							Run Lines we use a 20 cent line. The favorite has
							the negative number next to it showing the price you
							have to lay to play that side and the underdog
							almost always has a positive number next to it
							showing the price you would win by playing it. Below
							is an example of a typical baseball game.
						</p>

						<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>Mets - Hampton</td>
									<td>-134 9ov -105</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Marlins - Dempster</td>
									<td>+124 9un -115</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If you want to place a $100 wager on the Mets,
								you would be risking $134 to win $100.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you want to place a $100 wager on the
								Marlins, you would risk $100 to win $124.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you want to place a $100 wager on over 9
								runs, you would risk $105 to win $100.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you want to place a $100 wager on under 9
								runs, you would risk $115 to win $100.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							When betting Baseball Money Lines you can chose the
							following options for your
							wagers:&nbsp;<strong>ACTION</strong>,&nbsp;<strong
								>LISTED PITCHERS (LP)</strong
							>,&nbsp;<strong
								>YOUR TEAM&apos;S PITCHER (PT)</strong
							>
							or&nbsp;<strong>OPPOSING PITCHER (TP)</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							NOTE: The starting pitchers are determined after the
							first pitch. In the event of a pitching change prior
							to the game, the money price may be adjusted and
							your bet may change if you play with action.
						</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>Action:</dt>
							<dd>
								Your wager is team against team regardless of
								who the starting pitchers are. In case of a
								pitching change, your price will be adjusted to
								the opening number of the actual starting
								pitcher.
							</dd>
							<dt>Listed Pitchers (LP):</dt>
							<dd>
								Your wager is predicated on both listed pitchers
								throwing at least one pitch for you to have
								action. Both pitchers must start in order for
								you to have action on your wager, otherwise the
								bet will be declared NO ACTION after the game is
								final.
							</dd>
							<dt>Your team&apos;s Pitcher (PT):</dt>
							<dd>
								You are only taking the listed pitcher of the
								team you are wagering on. The pitcher selected
								must start the game for your wager to count. Any
								pitcher can start for the opposing team. In case
								of a pitching change on the opposing team, the
								price will still adjust to the opening price of
								the actual starters.
							</dd>
							<dt>Opposing Pitcher (TP):</dt>
							<dd>
								You are listing the opposing team&apos;s
								pitcher. Any starter can pitch for the team you
								selected. The opposing team&apos;s pitcher has
								to start. In the case of a pitching change on
								your team, the price will be adjusted to the
								opening price of the actual pitchers.
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<p>
							The other way to wager on a baseball game is to bet
							the run-line. Every favorite will be - 1 1/2 runs
							and could either be plus or minus money.
						</p>
						<p>
							Below is an example of what a run-line looks like.
						</p>
						<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>Mets - Hampton</td>
									<td>+1 1/2 +115</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Marlins - Dempster</td>
									<td>-1 1/2 -135</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<p>
							If you wager $100 on the Mets, you have the Mets
							minus 1 1/2 runs risking $100 to win $115. If you
							wager $100 on the Marlins, you have the Marlins plus
							1 1/2 runs risking $135 to win $100.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong
								>When wagering on Total Runs (over/under) and
								Run Lines (run spread)</strong
							>
							the game must go 9 innings (8 1/2 if the home team
							is winning). If the game is suspended after 9
							innings, the final score (for wagering purposes) is
							determined by the last full inning of play unless
							the home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the
							bottom half of the inning. In which case, the winner
							is determined by the score when the game is called.
							If with this rules the game is a TIE, Run Lines and
							Totals count. All wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines
							are ALWAYS with Listed Pitchers (LP). If both
							pitchers scheduled to pitch at the time of the wager
							do not throw at least one pitch then the wager will
							be cancelled. Wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are
							refunded in the event of a pitching change when the
							game is final.
						</p>
						<p>
							We do NOT accept Parlays, If Bets or Round Robins
							with the same game&apos;s Total and Run Line. Any
							wager of such type can be cancelled by us without
							prior notice.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>RAIN or SHINE Rule:</strong> Baseball Props
							including 1st Score, Yes/No Score in 1st inning, 1st
							5 inning line are graded as soon as that event
							occurs. For 1st 5 inning line the game must go into
							the 6th inning of play for action. Bets are final
							even if the game gets rained out or suspended.
						</p>
						<p>
							For any Player prop, the game must be completed
							in-full to have action. Games that are scheduled for
							7 Innings only and are completed (6.5 if home team
							is winning) are considered completed.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>2ND HALF LINES:</strong> 2nd half baseball
							score includes from the top of the 6th inning till
							the end of the game including extra innings. The
							game must be completed for action (9 full innings or
							8.5 innings if the home team is winning). All wagers
							on the 2nd half lines are action regardless of the
							pitcher. If Games are suspended and MORE than 9
							innings have been played the score will revert back
							to the last COMPLETE inning.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong
								>For baseball props and Alternate Runlines and
								Halves</strong
							>, ALL listed pitchers must go. On the player to get
							most total bases, the following scoring system is
							used: Single = 1 base, Double = 2 bases, Triple = 3
							bases, HR = 4 bases. Both players + starting
							pitchers must start for action. On Pool events ALL
							PLAYERS ARE ACTION unless otherwise specified.
							Baseball props can be used for Straight bets,
							Parlays, If Bets and/or Round Robins (NO TEASERS) as
							long as the other Team in such wagers does not
							belong to the same Family. Any wagers within the
							same Family (OR PROPS USED IN TEASERS) will be
							cancelled by us without prior notice.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Baseball Series:</strong> Baseball Series
							are games played between two teams (Regular Season
							Only). Neither team can play any other opponent
							between the scheduled games in the series. The
							following are the main rules used to grade the
							Baseball Series:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								All games in a series count towards wager. In a
								four game series 2-2 is a tie.
							</li>
							<li>
								A series is considered action if one game has
								been played.
							</li>
							<li>
								If a game during the series is called, this game
								will be considered good for the series as long
								as one of the teams is officially declared the
								winner of the game.
							</li>
							<li>
								All wagers are based on ACTION in regard to the
								pitchers in each games.
							</li>
							<li>
								A suspended game from a previous series that is
								completed is not considered part of the current
								series.
							</li>
							<li>
								These rules may differ from other sportsbooks.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							So if a series starts on Friday and ends on Monday,
							it will be graded out on Monday, with all games
							counting towards the result.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>College World Series games</strong> (all
							college baseball games) that are suspended are
							considered to be in a long rain delay and will be
							graded when the game reaches its official ending.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>For the World Baseball Classic (WBC)</strong
							>, during the first two rounds of play, both sides
							and totals have action regardless of the Mercy Rule.
							For the Semi Finals and Final of the WBC, the Mercy
							Rule is not in effect therefore games will follow
							normal playoff rules. In case of discrepancy or
							items not covered, Las Vegas gaming rules will
							apply.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Totals, Runs, Hits and Errors:</strong> A
							game must go 8 and a half innings if home team is
							winning, or 9 if the road team is winning for
							action.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>GRAND SALAMI</strong> For grand salami
							wagers, every game on the board has to go the full 9
							innings (81/2 if the home team is winning) otherwise
							it will be cancelled.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pitchers do not matter, meaning that if there is a
							pitching change on any game your bet will still have
							action.
						</p>
						<p>
							For League Grand Salami, it will only take to
							account games played on that specific league,
							example: National League Grand Salami will only
							include games from the National League schedule and
							not National League teams that could be playing on
							Interleague games.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong
								>** Exception: Playoff baseball games do not
								fall under the suspended game rule in accordance
								to Major League Baseball guidelines to finish
								all games. If a game is suspended due to weather
								or darkness all bets will remain pending until
								the game is declared final.</strong

						</p>
						<h3>Softball and Little League</h3>
						<p>
							Softball or little league game ending early as a
							result of a mercy rule will have action on all
							wagers (unless otherwise noted). If a game is
							suspended or postponed due to weather or darkness
							all bets will remain pending until the game is

						</p>
						<p>
							NCAA regular season Softball --- Games ending early

						<p>
							<strong
								>These are the ways that we offer for Golf
								Betting:</strong
							>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>To Win the Tournament:</strong>
								Customers bet on one of the players to be the
								champion of the Tournament.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>To Finish in the Top 5:</strong> The Top
								5 finishers and anybody who tied with the fifth
								finisher.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>To Finish in the Top 10:</strong> The
								Top 10 finishers and anybody who tied with the
								tenth finisher.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Match-ups:</strong> We pair up players
								and the customer picks one of them to have a
								better record than the other. We offer Match-ups
								for the entire tournament and on major events we
								also offer Round Match-ups betting.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>3 Ball Betting:</strong> In 3 Ball
								Betting 3 golfers are matched up and the golfer
								with the best score wins the pool. 3 Ball
								Betting can be offered for the entire tournament
								or for a specific round. If two players are tied
								for the win in the pool then prices will be
								split between the number of winning players (2).
								If the 3 players are all tied in their scores
								then the 3 Ball Betting is considered NO ACTION
								and all wagers will be refunded.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>6 Ball Shooter:</strong> In 6 Ball
								Shooters 6 golfers are matched up and the golfer
								with the best score wins the pool. 6 Ball
								Shooter can be offered for the entire tournament
								or for the specific round. If two players are
								tied for the win in the pool then prices will be
								split between the number of winning players. If
								the 6 players are all tied in their scores then
								the 3 Ball Betting is considered NO ACTION and
								all wagers will be refunded.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Top Player in a group:</strong> On major
								tournaments we offer pools such as TOP AMERICAN
								player in the tournament. In such pools if ties
								for the best position occur, the prices will be
								split between the number of winning players.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Round Leader:</strong> On major
								tournaments we offer a pool for the best score
								in a specific round of play. In such pools if
								ties for the best score occur, the prices will
								be split between the number of winning players.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							<strong>For Matchups</strong> the player must tee
							off in order to be considered action. If a player
							does not tee off, then any wager involving him would
							be considered no action and will be cancelled.The
							exception to this rule is when the wager is made on
							a pool and all players have action regardless if
							they start or not the tournament. (ex: to win
							TOURNAMENT)
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>If a players tees off</strong>, he is in
							action regardless of the number of holes played.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Example of a Tournament Matchup:</strong></p>
						<table
							border="0"
							cellpadding="2"
							cellspacing="1"
							width="150"
						>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td><strong>Fred Funk</strong></td>
									<td><strong>- 125</strong></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><strong>Joe Durant</strong></td>
									<td><strong>+105</strong></td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<p>
							In this tournament match-If a customer picks Fred
							Funk, the wager is on Fred Funk to have a better
							record than Joe Durant. Not necessarily that Funk
							must win the championship but that he will end up in
							a better position than Durant. Both players must Tee
							Off in the tournament for the matchup to have
							action. In a two-player match-up wager, the player
							completing the most holes is declared the winner. If
							both players complete the same number of holes then
							the lowest score wins.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Specific Rounds:</strong> Aside the odds to
							win the whole Tournament, we may also offer odds to
							win a specific round. So a customer can bet on a
							player to win the 3rd round only. If this is the
							case we will specify that the bet is for the round
							only and not for the whole tournament. Both players
							must tee off in the specified round for action. 4th
							round does not include playoffs
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>When a point scoring method is used</strong>
							such as Stableford, then the highest number of point
							wins. The only exception to this rule is when a
							tournament is rain shortened and the final scores
							are determined by the PGA usually by reverting back
							to the last completed round.
						</p>
						<p>
							On Top Player betting or Group betting if two or
							more players tie for the best place in the pool, the
							prices of the wagers will be divided by the number
							of the winning players.
						</p>
						<p>
							We ONLY accept Straight Bets when wagering on Golf
							regardless if it is a wager on To Win Tournament,
							Top 5, Top 10, Tournament Matchups, Round Matchups
							or Top Player Betting. Any other type of wager that
							is not a straight wager (Example: Parlays, If Bets,
							Reverses and/or Round Robins) will be cancelled by
							us without prior notice.

						<h3>Boxing | Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) | UFC</h3>
						<p>
							<strong
								>For boxing there are three types of
								wagers:</strong
							>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>To Win the Fight:</strong> Picking the
								fighter that the customer thinks will win the
								fight. Draws will cancel these wagers.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Total of Rounds:</strong> Customer will
								either go over or under a number of rounds in
								which the fight will be finished.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Correct Result Wagering:</strong>
								Players can wager on which boxer will win the
								fight and the manner in which the fight is won.
								A KNOCKOUT includes Technical Knockouts (TKO)
								and Disqualifications (DQ). A DECISION is
								determined to be anytime the judge&apos;s
								scorecards are used to determine the winner of
								the bout regardless of the round in which this
								occurs. DRAW is a wagering option and if a DRAW
								occurs the other Correct Result Wagers will be
								losers.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Lets say the line on the rounds in a fight is 4.5 (3
							minutes). If a player takes the over, he&apos;s
							saying that the fight will last more than 4.5
							rounds. That would be 4 full rounds and the first
							1.5 minutes into the 5th round (1 minute and 30
							seconds).
